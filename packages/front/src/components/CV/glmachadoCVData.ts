          Nelogica is the biggest trading software company in Brazil, and has several trading platforms. 
          I came to the company I to work as a web developer in the homebrokers, 
          [profit web](${CVLinks.profitWeb}) and [vector web](${CVLinks.vectorWeb}) applications using vue and javascript.
          Later on I started to guide my work towards performance improvements and async operations handling.
          As the project grew we started to work with typescript and ported our product to [MacOS](${CVLinks.profitChartMacOS}) using electron, bringing the company to the MacOS users.
          In 2023 I was invited to work in the company's headquarters in Porto Alegre and started to work with the mobile team, and
          led technically the development of native mobile apps using the core web code. Now we target web, [Android](${CVLinks.profitChartAndroid}),
          [iOS](${CVLinks.IOS}) and MacOS with the same main codebase and some native adjusts.
          In late 2024 I started a new role as the team leader of our web and macOS products, as well as the core web code.`,
